    "\n",
    "- **SNP** : Single Nuclotide Polymorphism. A single DNA change. These are the \"data points\" in genetic studies.\n",
    "- **Allele** : Variant of a SNP\n",
    "- **Odds Ratio** (OR) : Measures how much an allele increases risk \n",
    "- **95% CI** : Confidence Interval for the Odds Ratio\n",

    "# Approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Simulation**\n",
    "- Generated a dataset of 1000 individuals (500 cases with heart attacks and 500  controls)\n",
    "- Simulated 50 genetic markers (SNPs) with 5 designed to have a true association with heart attacks. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Quality Control**\n",
    "- Checked for missing data \n",
    "- Visualized allele frequency distribution to ensure data integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Statistical Analysis**\n",
    "- Performed chi-square tests to assess association between SNPs and heart attach risk \n",
    "- Calculated odds ratio (OR) to measure the effect sizes. \n",
    "    - OR = 1 No effect (SNP doesn't influence risk)\n",
    "    - OR > 1 SNP increases heart attack risk ( OR=2 means twice as likely to have a heart attack if the risk allele is present)\n",
    "    - OR < 1 SNP may be protective, indicative of reduces risk\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Mutlitple Testing Correlation**\n",
    "- Applied Bonferroni correction to control for false positives due to testing multiple SNPs. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Visualization & Interpretation**\n",
    "- Created a Manhattan plot to highlight significant SNPs\n",
    "- Plotted odds rations for the most promising genetic markers "

    "- Demostrated that proper multiple correction is essential to avoid false positive discoveries. "
